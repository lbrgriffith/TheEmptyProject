# The Empty Project (Origins)
I've always had a special place in my heart for Linux!  I'm a Windows developer, who works on MacOS and Linux quite frequently and 
I start to miss all the tools and commands of the other operating systems.  One command in particular I find useful is the linux **touch** command.
The touch command does a few things, like changes a file's properties such as access time and modification time, but the most feature for me is creating empty files. 
I wouldn't mind building a simple CLI application to do much the same functions as Linux's tounch command, but on Windows.

Simple right?

Well, here is the challenge (for me, anyway) - I'm going ot use the [Rust langauge](https://www.rust-lang.org/). 
Oh, I don't know how to program in Rust...yet.  Sounds fun right?  You are welcome to contribute.

## First Thing's First
My first task: build the app create one file!
